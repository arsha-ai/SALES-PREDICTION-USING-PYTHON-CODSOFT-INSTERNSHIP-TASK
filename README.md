# Sales Prediction Model - codsoft internship task

This project implements a machine learning model to predict sales based on advertising budgets for different media channels (TV, Radio, and Newspaper). It uses a Random Forest Regressor to capture potential non-linear relationships in the data.


## Features

- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Random Forest Regression model for prediction
- Interactive command-line interface for user input
- Visualization of feature importance
- Continuous prediction capability with user option to make multiple predictions


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
##  Installation

-  Clone this repository:https://github.com/arsha-ai/SALES-PREDICTION-USING-PYTHON-CODSOFT-INSTERNSHIP-TASK.git

-  Navigate to the project directory: cd sales-prediction

- Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt


## Running the model

Run the model with the given dataset 'advertising .csv' and add your directory to the model to execute the code sucessfully.
